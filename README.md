# **Tic Tac Toe**

This is a multiplayer version of my previous project [tic-tac-toe-react](https://github.com/lucasfgs/tic-tac-toe-react). I'm using socket.io to make real time connections with client and server.

## **Install**

You need to install all dependencies from game and server folder.

**Install all dependencies**

_With npm:_

```
npm install
```

_With yarn:_

```
yarn install
```

## **Usage**

Before start your app and server you need to set a port of your server in server/src/index.js. Then you need to go in game/src/services/socket.js and set your socket location (probably https://localhost:8000) replacing "PUT YOUR SERVER SOCKET ADDRESS HERE".

**Start the app:**

_With npm:_

```
npm start
```

_With yarn:_

```
yarn start
```
